# MMM-Powerwall

This is a module for the
[MagicMirrorÂ²](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror/).  It displays data from
your [Tesla Powerwall](https://www.tesla.com/powerwall) on your Magic Mirror,
optionally including car charging data pulled from your
[TWCManager](https://github.com/ngardiner/TWCManager/) (v1.2.0 or later).

If using all the graphs, this works best in one of the full-width positions
(`upper_third`, `middle_center`, `lower_third`); individual graphs can work
nicely in other positions.

## Using the module

To use this module, clone this repo into ~/MagicMirror/modules, run `npm
install` to get dependencies, and add the following configuration block to the
modules array in the `config/config.js` file:
```js
var config = {
    modules: [
        {
            module: 'MMM-Powerwall',
            position: 'lower_third',
            config: {
                // See below for configurable options
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
You will need to restart the MagicMirror process to load the node_helper.

Authentication depends on Python, due to issues with Node and Raspberry Pi.
Make sure you have Python and requests installed:  `sudo apt install python3 python3-requests`

**Do not forget to run `npm install` after updating the module; new dependencies
are being introduced because of Tesla's new authentication model.**

## Configuration options

| Option                | Description
|---------------------- |-----------
| `powerwallIP`         | *Required* IP address of the Powerwall endpoint to query
| `powerwallPassword`   | *Optional* Password for local Powerwall endpoint
| `teslaAPIUsername`    | *Recommended* Username for your Tesla account
| `siteID`              | *Optional* if your Tesla account has exactly one energy site; required if multiple are present
| `twcManagerIP`        | *Optional* IP address or hostname of TWCManager instance; if omitted, Tesla API data will be used
| `twcManagerPort`      | *Optional* port of TWCManager's web interface; default is `8080`
| `graphs`              | *Optional* Array of tiles to show. Possible values are described below; default is all
| `localUpdateInterval` | *Optional* How often (in milliseconds) to poll local endpoints (Powerwall and TWCManager)<br>Default 10000 milliseconds (10 seconds)
| `cloudUpdateInterval` | *Optional* How often (in milliseconds) to poll Tesla API<br>Default 300000 milliseconds (five minutes)
| `home`                | *Optional* Coordinates (`[lat, lon]`) of your home; used to indicate when car is at home and to get sunrise/sunset times
| `debug`               | *Optional* Enables additional debug output to the browser tools Console and to stderr on the MM, useful for troubleshooting
| `powerlineClip`       | *Optional* Controls clipping behavior on PowerLine graph; see below for values
| `teslamate`           | *Optional* See below

### Graphs

This module implements several different graphs.  Currently, these are:

- CarCharging<br>![](images/CarCharging.png)
- Grid<br>![](images/Grid.png)
- PowerwallSelfPowered<br>![](images/PowerwallSelfPowered.png)
- SolarProduction<br>![](images/SolarProduction.png)
- HouseConsumption<br>![](images/HouseConsumption.png)
- EnergyBar<br>![](images/EnergyBar.png)
- PowerLine<br>![](images/PowerLine.png)

By default, all are displayed.  However, as needed by your layout, you can
instantiate multiple instances of this module, each displaying different graphs
or even targeting different Powerwall systems.  All data is requested, cached,
and distributed by the node_helper, so multiple instances referencing the same
target will still update simultaneously and will not increase the volume of
requests made to either local or cloud endpoints.

#### PowerLine clipping

The PowerLine graph automatically scales to your daily usage; extreme peaks can
throw off this scaling. It can clip the extreme values to enable better view of
the rest of the graph.

Possible values:

  - false - do not clip
  - null/default - clip at most one category
  - true - clip extremes

### Authentication

This module relies on being able to access your Powerwall both locally and via
the Tesla API.  On older firmware versions, the local endpoint interactions
required no authentication; this changed in 20.49.0. There are two
authentication paths:

- **Sign in via the module. (Recommended)** After installing the module, visit
  `/MMM-Powerwall/auth` on your MagicMirror HTTP port, e.g.
  `http://192.168.0.52:8080/MMM-Powerwall/auth`.  You can provide tokens for the
  Tesla API (links to apps which can help are on that page) and/or the password
  for your Powerwall's local API.  The module will cache tokens for the Tesla
  API, but needs to retain the actual password for the local API. It is NOT
  RECOMMENDED that this be the same password used for your Tesla account.  If
  signing in this way, you only need to include your username and Powerwall IP
  in the module configuration.

- **Include your passwords in the module configuration. (Local only)**
  Note that the client downloads `config.js` during load, so anything in your
  config file passes unencrypted over the network (unless you've set up TLS).
  This method also does not work with the Tesla API.

The module will generate `tokens.json` (for the Tesla API) and `localpw.json`
(for the local Powerwall) after the first successful load with the password(s),
so you can remove the password from your `config.js` file afterward if desired.

Neither the password nor the tokens are sent anywhere except from the
node_helper to the Tesla API.  Feel free to verify this in the code.

### Teslamate Integration

If you have installed [Teslamate](https://github.com/adriankumpf/teslamate), it
exposes an MQTT server with information about monitored Tesla vehicles.  To
make the best use of this integration:

- Your mosquitto instance should have the options `persistence true` and a 
  `persistence_location` configured.
- Either set `allow_anonymous true` or provide a username and password in options.

The `teslamate` configuration option is an object with the following fields:

| Option        | Description
|-------------- |-----------
| `url`         | *Required* URL to access the Mosquitto server
| `namespace`   | *Optional* If you have configured a custom namespace (with MQTT_NAMESPACE), supply it here
| `options`     | *Optional* If you need to pass any [options](https://github.com/mqttjs/MQTT.js/#client) to the MQTT client, supply them here.

The Teslamate connection will be associated with the Tesla account supplied
in the same config.
